description: "Michelle Vossen is a cross-disciplinary designer working with textiles and technology based in Amsterdam & Utrecht. Michelleâ€™s practice revolves around humans and machines collaborating in textile crafts. Machine-made never means monotony when your hands are constantly involved in the process.
<br><br>
Regular buttons and smooth touchscreens are boring, so her focus is on creating soft tactile interfaces. She likes creating tangible interactions that make you move and touch differently. Crafting textile sensors is a big part of this because of their playful nature: you may aim for a certain kind of value range and purpose, but the material has a big say in the process.
<br><br>
A major value in her work is DIY and learning-by-making. She brings this methodology to various workshops and events throughout the year, both freelance and in her position as Maker Educator at Waag Futurelab."
