# Mycelium experiments
Mycelium is the reproductive part of a mushroom, a network of threads of a fungi. Mycelium can be grown on basically any kind of organic waste.

## What you'll need
To get started on growing mycelium, you need:

- Mushroom roots (you can cut off tiny slices from the base of any mushroom) 
- Water
- Food (flour, cardboard, coffee grounds, peanut butter, there are many possibilities to experiment with)

Tools:
- A sealable container for the mycelium to grow in
- An oven to kill the mycelium in once you're satisfied with the result (killing it is necessary to stop the growing process)

Also check out Maud Bausier's (previous fablab intern) [documentation](https://maudb.gitlab.io/dok/projects/grow-mycelium/) on growing mycelium.

## Grey oyster starter
I bought grey oyster starter from [fryslan fungies](https://www.fryslanfungies.nl/winkel/broed-nieuw-opstartmateriaal/?attribute_pa_kleur=grijs).
