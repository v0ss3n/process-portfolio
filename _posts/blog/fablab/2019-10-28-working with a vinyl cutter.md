# Roland CAMM-1 Vinyl cutter
For the Vinyl cutter at the fablab, you need material (like sticker or tripa for fabric) and a file to cut. The file is an illustrator file saved to be compatible with CS2. The file is then sent to the plotter using the print menu in Illustrator. 

## First test
- Knife goes too deep
- Blocks are too small
- Too much waste of material
