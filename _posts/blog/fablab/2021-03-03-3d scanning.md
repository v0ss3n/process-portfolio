# 3d scanning
In the lab we have the Sense 2 3d scanner by 3d systems. This model is about 5 years old and could be bought around 400 euros (it's discontinued now). Personally I'm not a big fan of this scanner; it only really works for busts and there are better options available for (a lot) less money now. 

![3d scanner sense](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F3dscanexpert.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsense_2_3d_scanner_review_front-1024x507.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

I tried scanning objects with my Iphone 8 Plus with the app [Qlone](https://www.qlone.pro/). It is free to scan objects using this app; exporting to obj costs about 20 euros for unlimited exports. Although the app has a tendency to give 3d scans a bit of a 'roof' and is terrible with hollow objects (like cups), I was quite impressed with the results. You do need to print a grid (file provided by the app) so the scanner has a reference. I've printed one of 20x20cm but plan on printing one of 90x90cm later to try scanning larger objects. The small mat can be downloaded [here](https://www.qlone.pro/_files/ugd/0dc13a_3427b99878b3407d94e6ca136bff2fa9.pdf).

Some scans with Qlone:

## Comparison 
I scanned two objects using both the Sense 2 and the Qlone app with and without mat. I scanned a computer mouse and [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2064029) 3d printed model.

### Sense 2 results
The images below show the 3 steps in the post-processing of the scans. In both cases I had to start over multiple times because the camera lost track constantly. I couldn't scan half of the model and had to fill in the gaps using the software, which is pretty bad at it.

A side by side comparison of both methods:

### Qlone app with cloud processing (without mat)
First attempt failed, probably because of the LED lighting I used (while filming it flickers a lot). Second attempt (on the right)with natural light succeeded, but a lot of the background has been scanned too. I only scanned the tower model with cloud processing, since this method costs cloud credits and I don't plan on spending more money on this app, especially since I'm not particularly impressed by this new feature yet.
