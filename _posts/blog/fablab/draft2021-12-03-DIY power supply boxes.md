# DIY power supply boxes

## Components

## Box
For the boxes I decided to modify [this box from thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6982). I changed the file in Illustrator (even after repeatedly telling myself that I shouldn't do that anymore). For the small boxes this went surprisingly smooth, for the big box not so much. I'm gonna make a parametric version of a box like this since I just want it in Fusion and I have only found parametric box generators that produce boxes that you have to glue together. I like that this one can be easily assembled and disassembled with a few bolts and nuts.
