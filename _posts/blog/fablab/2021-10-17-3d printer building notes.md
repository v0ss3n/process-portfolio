# 3d printer building notes
I want to start printing with biomaterials, textile fiber based filaments and other custom filaments. I also want to recycle failed prints (like everyone else in 3d printing). What I'm guessing that I'm gonna need is:

- a filament extruder
- a shredder (for textiles and for plastics)
- diy extruders/modifiers for 3d printers
