# Transferpaper prints on fabric
For these experiments I am hiding visually encrypted messages in 2d prints using transfer paper. Before this I tried 3D printing but that did not turn out to be a great method for hiding these messages as they were either indecipherable or falling off the fabric. For more information on the process, go to [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}\textilelab\2019\11\01\3d-printing-experiments-on-fabric-(visual-cryptography).html)).

## Process
- When using transferpaper make sure that you mirror your image before you print it on the paper
- A heat press usually works better than an iron
- If you do use an iron, take your time (especially with synthetic seethrough materials like I did)

Note how when laying flat the symbol is vaguely visible, only when you are looking for it.
