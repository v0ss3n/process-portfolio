# HILO spinning wheel

Polyjet prints: the driving wheel and trailing wheel are printed with two filaments in one print, but since we couldn't do that I printed the wheels separately and assembled them after which worked just as well. 

Settings hard wheels:
- Printed on Prusa MK3S
- PLA
- Infill 40%
- Layer height 0.3mm (draft setting)

Settings soft wheels:
- Printed on UM2+
- Filaflex (see settings below)
- Infill 100%
- Layer height 0.3mm
- No retraction

I didn't add glue in between the parts, they just fit nicely and feel secure as they are; if needed glue can be added between the parts.
