# Biofabricating materials
_Cecilia Raspanti_

This last century we have been crafting, designing and growing materials independently from their future use. This has caused major design flaws in our daily lives, where we find ourselves surrounded by plastics, while observing knowledge about local materials and techniques disappear and left unused even when in abundance. This class will focus on exploring material alternatives to the current ones. By bridging craftsmanship techniques and todays easier access to technologies, we explore alternative material resources in order to craft their processing and develop products and materials hand in hand.
