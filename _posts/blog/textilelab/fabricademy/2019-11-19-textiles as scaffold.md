# Textiles as scaffold
_Anastasia Pistofidou_

Technical textiles have various applications, among which agrotech, building, clothes, geotech, sports. In this class we will use textiles for composites, polymerisation, solidification, fabric formwork, crystallization, composites and biocomposites, agglomerates.

This class focuses on exploring techniques and applications of technical textiles in the industry. It introduces the concept of designing custom processes that require the design of a set of tools, processes and workflow.

## Output
- [My documentation on 3D milling]({{ site.baseurl }}/fablab/2019/12/16/CNC-milling-machine-(3D).html).
- [My experiments with molding gloves using bioplastics and various textile hardeners]({{ site.baseurl }}/wetlab/textilelab/2020/02/03/glove-molding-experiments.html)
