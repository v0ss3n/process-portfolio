<div markdown="1" class="introduction">
The current field of electronic textiles lacks an artisanal approach to e-textiles in which craft is on an equal footing with design and technology. This project focuses on experimenting with traditional textile techniques: to investigate how these can be used to make artisanal, applied electronic textiles. The focus of the experiment is on spinning conductive and resistive fibers into thread, because the thread is the key to virtually any fabric. The spun threads are then processed into sensors by weaving and knitting them, and used as a tactile interface.

Something that strikes me in both my own e-textile research and within the broader (online) e-textiles community is that a lot of e-textiles research remains with prototypes and educational samples. This does not mean that there are no interesting, applied e-textiles projects and are being made, but it does strike me that many example e-textiles projects are already ten to fifteen years old. In these projects you can see on the one hand an industrial approach, where the textiles are machine-made with very professional and technical (but sometimes a bit dry) results, and on the other hand a more DIY, 'crafty' approach to textiles, where the textile is made by hand, but the end result is not always finished and applied.

## Research question
On the one hand, electronic textiles sometimes remain crafty in terms of manufacturing, and on the other hand, very technical and academic: there is a missing place in the middle where craft and technology come together. Investigating that place is the core of this experiment. Is there a possibility that technology can be approached and innovated using artisanal methods? And can this be done in a way where the maker is both a designer and a craftsman - an artisan?

I think approaching electronic textiles from a craft perspective can offer interesting reflection on what it means to be a contemporary artisan in the Netherlands in the field of textile crafts and DIY electronics. The question that arises from this is:

### How can traditional textile techniques - in particular spinning - be used to make applied electronic textiles in an artisanal way?

This question is the search for an artisanal answer to electronic components and to the existing academic, industrial and 'crafty' approaches to e-textiles. Thread is the basis of any piece of woven or knitted textile, so that's why it's so important to make it the focus of this experiment.

This question is divided into the following sub-questions:

1. **Context**: What defines a contemporary artisan? Can you approach e-textiles in the same way to become an e-textile artisan?
2. **Craft**: What are suitable materials and spinning techniques to make traditional sensors?
3. **Textile design**: What makes a traditionally made sensor artisanal? What requirements must an artisanal sensor meet to be considered applied textile design?
4. **Tactility**: What is the added value of handspun compared to industrially manufactured threads for a rich visual and haptic experience of a tactile sensor?

### 1. Context

#### What defines a contemporary artisan?
In the dutch context, this is actually a matter of what you make of it, since the term is not protected. If you want to call yourself an artisan, you can; no one can stop you. This is not the definition I would like to go by though.

- Legally, an artisan doesn't mean anything

During this project, I've spoken to many spinners. Most of them are not spinning professionally but as a hobby. I've met them at spinning circles, workshops and markets. Some of the hobbyists are still finding ways to make some extra money through textile crafts, but not necessarily through spinning. 

When does skill and practice turn into practicing a craft? I've spoken with Gregor about his view on this and tried to define the blurry boundaries between the artist, hobbyist, craftsperson and artisan.


Most hand spinners I've met are not living off of hand spinning. They either have other methods of earning a living, or are not primary bread winners (so no financial pressure). Other methods of earning a living as a professional hand spinners is through education, so giving spinning workshops or hosting spinning circles. 

There are also spinners that have businesses that relate to wool, and do hand spinning as part of that. 

, in which case hand spinning is an extra income stream

Fase 1 - onderzoek
Het onderzoek begint met het verzamelen van informatie over de historische en hedendaagse
van handspinners en artisans, om een antwoord op deelvraag 1 te formuleren.

Historically the Netherlands had some areas 

Daarnaast wordt een eisenlijst voor de sensoren aan de hand van de verzamelde kennis,
en aan het onderzoeken en verzamelen van materiaal (vezels) om mee te werken
gedurende dit project. Ook ben ik benieuwd naar de visie van artisans in Nederland op
hun vak en mijn toepassing ervan, dus gesprekken met minimaal twee ambachtspersonen
zijn onderdeel van het onderzoek. Het tweede deel van het onderzoek gaat over de
materialen om mee te spinnen. In dit deel wordt deelvraag 2 deels beantwoord (geschikte
materialen). Het materiaal wordt onderzocht door kleine spinproeven te maken
en hiervan de geleiding te meten. Tot slot worden alle sensoren gedocumenteerd en
samen met het antwoord op de hoofdvraag gedeeld in een blog post.

Requirement list for the sensors
From my own frustrations and experience the following...

technical and practical requirements
- Should be able to handle repeated touch, i.e. handle frictions and stress. Generally, worsted spun yarns are stronger and can handle more repeated use whereas woolen spun yarns 
- 

### Lessons learned
#### Knitting (3b)
- Fine gauge knitting machine really not suitable for thicker yarns - this is something that I should've thought about beforehand since it's pretty logical. I only have a fine gauge knitting machine, and although I looked into getting a coarse knitter on Marktplaats, they tend to be way more expensive than fine gauge machines. Luckily I could make use of a coarse knitting machine at my previous workplace (thank you Manon!). 
- I used mainly stitch size 7-10 on the coarse knitter using all needles. When knitting with handspun yarn, making swatches is essential to figure out the correct stitch size to make the yarn shine. I only made one swatch for each yarn and decided on the stitch size based on my intuition (i.e. my experience with knitting). This worked out okay-ish, but resulted in some swatches being too stiff. When a swatch is too stiff, sometimes the special features of the yarn is completely hidden within the stitches, which is a shame. With more time and more yarn I could have made more tests, but I had neither. 


#### Fiber preparation (1b)
The biggest thing I've learned in this project is that fiber preparation is everything. I've taken it into account already in my project proposal, but I did not really account for it as much as I should have. 

Two mistakes I made in the beginning of my project was to buy unwashed, unpicked and uncarded alpaca wool (1) on Marktplaats (2) sorted in two different qualities (A and B, mostly relating to fiber length) and 3 different colors. Since I had experience with the raw material already I figured it would be a beautiful (to the eye and to the touch), nice to work with and inexpensive starting point, but it ended up costing me way more time than I anticipated in washing (and waiting for it to dry) and carding it by hand. I learned that it's better to spend a bit more money on fibers that have already been washed and carded and are ready for use. 

The second lesson is that when buying raw materials, you need to feel and see them first - this became very obvious when I went to the weversmarkt in Hoorn. Every sheep/alpaca/plant fiber is different and seeing and touching the material is essential before buying. I got the alpaca from Marktplaats shipped to my house, and then I realized both how much I had bought, how short the fibers were, and how many thick hairs (.... haren) there were. You can see this clearly in the yarn I made with the B quality fiber, there are a lot of fibers poking out and it's very prickly.

## Materials
### Conductive
I'm looking into two categories - fibers and threads/wires. Although spinning techniques can also be applied to existing yarns, it's my goal to make my own yarns. However, I read in my spinning book that if you need a strong material that will not be visible in the final yarn, it may as well be commercial yarn, and I think I can get behind that (and over my purist intentions). I think I can also apply this to 100% conductive wires and filaments. It doesn't really add to my research to make all of the fully conductive material myself if they are going to be hidden. I also think there is value in wrapping handspun yarn in thin conductive wires - like my [favorite yarn](https://bart-francis.be/nl/etextile-high-tech-garen-co/etextile-linen-gimp-fantasy-and-practical-aplications-50-gr-100-met/a-5342-128) from bart & francis. So basically core yarn in both directions.

#### Fibers
- [Stainless steel fibers](https://imattec.com/en/stainless-steel.php) - variocut (Immatec, mixed directions)
- [Stainless steel fibers](https://imattec.com/en/stainless-steel.php) - sliver (Immatec, combed)
- Conductive wool - stainless steel fibers and merino premixed (bart & francis, currently not for sale)
- [Crimped conductive fibers](https://www.shieldex-shop.com/en/product-page/shieldex-crimped-fibers) (Shieldex)
- [Steel wool](https://www.amazon.nl/Shineboc-Herbruikbaar-Krasbestendig-gereedschap-Messing-16m/dp/B0CMTF2STP) - see <http://thomas-gerhardt.com/itp/FeltResistor/>


#### Wire
- Uncoated thin copper wire (<koper-draad.nl>, for core spinning)
- Monofilament thin stainless steel wire (<https://www.shieldex-shop.com/en/product-page/shieldex-150-%CE%BC-monofil>)

#### Beads
- Metal beads (Copenhagen shop in Amsterdam)
- Aliexpress (sorry)

#### Coatings
- Paints
- Glues
  - [DIY graphite based conductive glue](https://www.instructables.com/Make-Conductive-Glue-and-Glue-a-Circuit/) using [liquid tape from Performix](https://www.amazon.nl/Elektrische-isolatie-vloeibare-Plasti-Dip/dp/B077QJ55XH)
- Sprays
  - [Graphite spray](http://www.kontaktchemie.com/KOC/KOCproductdetailV2.csp?product=GRAPHIT%2033)
- Electroplating

I've looked at these options but since these are more finishes and not necessarily part of spinning, I'm leaving them out of the equation (also since they tend to be pretty expensive and messy).

## Glossary
Picking - removing debris from wool by opening up the locks so it falls out
Hekelen (NL)
Carding
Hand carding 
- don't overload the carder, otherwise carding is harder and drafting from the resulting rolag is harder
- card the wool, not the carder. the teeth should barely touch
- brush across 4-8 times
Beard - fibers on the edge of the hand carder
Batt - fiber ...
Flicker (flick carder)
Combing
Diz
Combing milk (spinning oil)

Twisting
Plying
Singles - the building blocks of yarn
- If a single stays a single, it should be stable with its twist; if it's going to be plied, it needs extra twist

Leader - yarn that is tied to the bobbin
Woolen yarn - airy, fuzzy, warm yarn, long backward draw, spun from rolags
Worsted yarn - compact, sleek, strong yarn, more suited for weaving than woolen, short forward draw, spun from combed top
Spinning off the fold
Skein
I should wash the yarn before processing maybe
Niddy noddy

Spinning wheel
Whorl - the pulley; the smaller the whorl, the more revolutions the flyer makes each time the wheel goes around; the smaller the whorl the smaller the diameter yarn


Rolag - rolled-up cylinder of wool
Puni - smaller rolag (for shorter fibers)

Gender in spinning history - carding for boys, spinning for girls and mothers
Fiber preparation in summer, spinning in winter

Physical version like a pronkrol / souvenir de ma jeunesse on a scroll on a big spool.

Connections: since I want it to be modular (being able to take off samples easily), I can't just sew them to the base scroll. I spent a bit too long looking into book screws, but they're pretty big in both visible diameter (10mm) and inner diameter (since it needs to accomodate a screwing mechanism) so they're not very subtle. Other options are:
- tie tacks with butterfly clutch
