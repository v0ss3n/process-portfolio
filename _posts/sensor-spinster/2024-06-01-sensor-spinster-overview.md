<div markdown="1" class="introduction">
The current field of electronic textiles lacks an artisanal approach to e-textiles in which craft is on an equal footing with design and technology. This project focuses on experimenting with traditional textile techniques: to investigate how these can be used to make artisanal, applied electronic textiles. The focus of the experiment is on spinning conductive and resistive fibers into thread, because the thread is the key to virtually any fabric. The spun threads are then processed into sensors by weaving and knitting them, and used as a tactile interface.

Something that I see in both my own e-textile research and within the broader (online) e-textiles community is that a lot of e-textiles research remains with prototypes and educational samples. This does not mean that there are no interesting, applied e-textiles projects and are being made (there are!!!); I am speaking generally and from my own observations which are limited to what I am able to find online and offline (in exhibitions and books). I am very aware that I am not seeing all there is, but I do think that I am seeing at least part of a picture. 
<!-- 
When I went to visit the Textielmuseum library I looked at their e-textiles/fashion tech corner, I found books on e-textiles that can broadly speaking be divided in 3 categories: academic books, DIY project books and books that gather/catalog various different fashion technology projects and artists. Most of the books in the second and third category are at least 10 years old. I'm not sure whether this means that there are no new interesting books or projects, or if this means that the collection hasn't been updated in a long time. The academic books are more recent and seem very interesting - it seems to me that this is where most of the development is going on now (but maybe this is confirmation bias).

It does strike me that many example e-textiles projects are already ten to fifteen years old. In these projects you can see on the one hand an industrial approach, where the textiles are machine-made with very professional and technical (but sometimes a bit dry) results, and on the other hand a more DIY, 'crafty' approach to textiles, where the textile is made by hand, but the end result is not always finished and applied. -->

**Research question**
On the one hand, electronic textiles sometimes remain crafty in terms of manufacturing, and on the other hand, very technical and academic: there seems to be a missing place in the middle where craft and technology come together. Investigating that place is the core of this experiment. Is there a possibility that technology can be approached and innovated using artisanal methods? And can this be done in a way where the maker is both a designer and a craftsperson - an artisan?

I think approaching electronic textiles from a craft perspective can offer interesting reflection on what it means to be a contemporary artisan in the Netherlands in the field of textile crafts and DIY electronics. The question that arises from this is:

# How can traditional textile techniques - in particular spinning - be used to make applied electronic textiles in an artisanal way?

This question is the search for an artisanal answer to electronic components and to the existing academic, industrial and 'crafty' approaches to e-textiles. Thread is the basis of any piece of woven or knitted textile, so that's why it's so important to make it the focus of this experiment.

This question is divided into the following sub-questions:

1. **Context**: What defines a contemporary artisan? Can you approach e-textiles in the same way to become an e-textile artisan?
2. **Craft**: What are suitable materials and spinning techniques to make traditional sensors?
3. **Textile design**: What makes a crafted sensor artisanal? What requirements must an artisanal sensor meet to be considered applied textile design?
4. **Tactility**: What is the added value of hand spun compared to industrially manufactured threads for a rich visual and haptic experience of a tactile sensor?

A lot of my research and conclusions come from conversations with spinners and craftspeople; the resources online basically all copy each other anyway; but the conclusions I draw are my own and it's definitely not a scientific article, more an essay and reflections

## 1. Context: What defines a contemporary artisan?
Hand spinning yarn has been a necessity to make cloth for thousands of years - first by hand, then with simple tools like (drop) spindles, then with a variety of spinning wheels. All three processes have the constant involvement of the hands in the process. Then the industrial revolution came with the invention of spinning machines like the spinning jenny, which signaled the end of hand spinning as a viable profession, also in the Netherlands. This is demonstrated by what J.A.P.G. Boot writes in *Textielhistorische Bijdragen 26* about hand spinning in the eastern Netherlands at the beginning of the 19th century: â€˜As more spinning mills came into operation, hand spinning on spinning wheels had to decline, until eventually only very old spinners managed to make a living from it for an extremely meager wage. With them, hand spinning died out.'

**Spinning in the 70s**
Since then, hand spinning has seen some revivals throughout the years. I've been told by spinners at spinning circles that in the seventies, spinning had a huge revival as a hobby. When I was at the LSD (the Landelijke Spin Dag obviously) in october, I observed that the general audience was almost exclusively women, and that many seem to be over sixty. Some people I met at  spinning groups mentioned that they got introduced to spinning during the seventies revival, and I wondered if the LSD visitors got the spinning fever back then too.

Another interesting thing I learned is that it was popular to spin 'in the grease', meaning spinning unwashed wool straight from the sheep (possibly this has to do with the hippie/environmentalist mentality but I'm not sure), and this is why this is something a lot spinners still do, but it seems unlikely that this is how people used to spin historically since it's pretty gross.
 
Part of this experiment is to investigate whether hand spinning can become relevant again in a design context: hand spinning currently does not play a major role in textile design. It's seen a little in the work of textile artists like Sheila Hicks do incorporate 

### Artisan: artist, craftsperson, designer, hobbyist, amateur?
The definition of an artisan is something I've been thinking about a lot over the past months. From a language point of view, it's interesting to note that the word artisan does not have a dutch translation: we have the word 'artisanaal' to describe artisanal products, but other than that it's either translated to 'ambachtsman' or 'kunstenaar'. From a legal point of view, the word artisan doesn't mean anything in the Netherlands, since it's not a protected term. I looked in [this database](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/regprof/professions/bycountry) and there is not one creative/craft occupation that is regulated, protected or requires a diploma of any kind (see also <https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/buitenlands-diploma-in-nederland/beroepserkenning-beschermd-beroep>). So if you want to call yourself a craftsperson or an artisan, you can; no one can legally stop you. I don't think this is a very productive definition of an artisan though, so let's dive a little deeper.

Craftsperson - someone who skillfully practices a craft 
Artisan - a craftsperson who uses their medium to create art and design, inspired by the (traditional) craft itself in a contemporary way
Artist - someone with a drive to convey a message or tell stories with what they make, which determines their actions
Designer - 
Hobbyist/amateur

Am I an artisan? Who decides on that? At least according to someone that I consider an artisan I am: Gregor 

**Conversations with craftspeople**
When does skill and practice turn into practicing a craft? I've spoken with Gregor Falkenhagen about his view on this and tried to define the blurry boundaries between the artist, hobbyist, craftsperson and artisan.

During this project, I've spoken to many spinners. Most of them are not spinning professionally but as a hobby. I've met them at spinning circles, workshops and markets. Some of the hobbyists are still finding ways to make some extra money through textile crafts, but not necessarily only through spinning. 

Most hand spinners I've met are not living off of hand spinning. They either have other methods of earning a living, or are not primary bread winners (so no financial pressure). Other methods of earning a living as a professional hand spinners is through education, so giving spinning workshops or hosting spinning circles. 

There are also spinners that have businesses that relate to wool, and do hand spinning as part of that. 

, in which case hand spinning is an extra income stream 

My observations are that many craftspeople in textiles are hybrid, i.e. they do not just practice a craft but also educate, run a business around crafts and facilitate, or do research in academic environments. There is also people that I would call artisans rather than craftspeople 

**Professionalism versus amateurism**
There are also spinners and people who are busy with a craft but don't have to make a living from it, people who do it as a hobby or as a way to earn a little extra income, I see this for example in spinning groups and at markets but also people who are just busy with a craft at home. I asked Gregor if he sees a certain limit in that; whether you have to go outside and take yourself seriously before you are really a craftsman versus practicing a craft as a hobby?

According to Gregor, a craftsperson is a professional. You don't have to commit to a craft fulltime but you should take yourself seriously in your craft. When you craft just as a hobby, the ability ('het kunnen') is less important as there is no one that you have to do it for but yourself, it's more about the enjoyment of the act of the craft. When you use your craft daily and you use it to make (part of) a living, you approach your craft from a different perspective than when there is nothing really at stake. This urgency of the craft is essential 

**Reclaiming amateurism**
However, this does not mean that the quality of the craft is any less by default than when the craft is executed by a professional: there are many people (especially many women) who have done (textile) crafts their entire lives and who are extremely skillful at it and who also make their own designs. I think the word amateur is really interesting in this context. The word, coming from the french meaning lover/appreciator, means someone who practices a skill, hobby or craft on a non-professional basis and without pay. This definition sounds lovely and very fitting for someone who crafts at any level, but the problem is in the negative connotations of amateurism: it can also be used for someone who acts without knowledge or expertise, who makes low(er) quality work than 'real' professional craftspeople. I think these connotations and associations with domesticity and women are also why textile arts have not been taken seriously in the art world in general. 

To me, the love of the craft is very much part of why I try to incorporate it into my artistic practice in the first place. I'm an amateur, a lover!



gregor gebruikt zijn ambacht iedere dag
je moet een drive hebben een boodschap uit te dragen als kunstenaar en dat bepaalt je handelen

de enige manier in de verrotte kleding wereld is om hybride bezig te zijn zoals samen met kunstenaars en als opleider
als je alleen maar spint voor de lol ben je hobbyist

het gaat ook om inkomen, of in ieder geval je leven mee bestrijdt 

over art yarn professional die welke kwalificatie heb je? waar komt de kennis vandaan? als je niet afhankelijk ervan bent voor inkomen

hobbyist die geld verdient of ambachtspersoon 

gregor is ook een ondernemer, visie doorzettingsvermogen en geduld 

gregor is een soort draad kunstenaar 
daarmee voelt gregor zich wel comfortabel
ik heb moeite mezelf kunstenaar noemen
volgens gregor ben ik zeker dingen aan het scheppen als een kunstenaar 

let erop dat ik mezelf niet te klein maak!! succesful kunstenaarschap is je connecties 

ik ben alles wat ik wil zijn volgens gregor

kun je een ambacht in je eentje leren van videoâ€™s en boeken? of is het netwerk van mensen eromheen die jou dingen leren noodzakelijk? 

het probleem met spinnen is misschien dat het een halffabrikaat is, nog meer dan weven bijv want daarvan kan je ook meteen een eindproduct maken vaak; aan de andere kant wordt handgesponnen draad wel degelijk verkocht op bijv de weversmarkt. ik zag ook art batt dat verkocht werd door bregje konings

wat is volgens jou artisanaal? en wat is het verschil met ambachtelijk? is er een verschil? 
wanneer kan je jezelf een ambachtspersoon noemen? en wanneer een artisan? want in nederland hebben we daar verder geen instantie voor die zoiets voor je kan erkennen


This definition on Wikipedia annoys me and I think it's outdated:
`Artisans practice a craft and may through experience and aptitude reach the expressive levels of an artist.`

I prefer to place the artisan and the artist next to each other. An artist does not necessarily have to be able **themselves** to make something skillfully in order to transmit their message: for example, artworks can be executed by craftspeople according to their vision, or the artist makes something themselves with a craft, but not execute it very well technically. To be clear - I don't have a problem with that, but I am trying to make a distinction between artists who take their medium seriously and develop together with the medium (that I would also call artisans), and artists where the medium is secondary to the message.


en kan ook ambachtsmensen en artisans inzetten en diens eigen naam erop plakken

gregor: zou handwerk gebruiken ipv ambachtspersoon, in duitsland is dat echt een vak leren en doen, met je handen werken puur het leren werken met je handen
meester en gezel, gezel is voor het afwerken, de meester gaat misschien naar het creatieve
een artisan is iemand die zich laat inspireren door traditie en het leven

meer van de aarde geleid, oude tradities en daar weer leven in blaast, niet zozeer die grenzen verplaatst maar meer vanuit de traditie de mooiste dingen maakt, een artisan creeert eigen processen, maar nog wel 

kunstenaar probeert onzichtbare dingen zichtbaar te maken, iets expressiefs maken letterlijk, iets in mensen naar buiten te brengen

een ontwerper is een baan, is een ontwerper een kunstenaar?? mengsel van vakman en kunstenaar, 
ontwerper benadering vanuit de mode

geen 100% kunstenaar gregor, wel wat in zich maar niet het dominante
wel een stukje kunstenaar in de stroming die in de wereld is zichtbaar te maken, maar vakman om dat uit te voeren 
procesopdeling, het eerste stuk van het proces, idee, lifestyle, baanverdeling, de eerste stap

er zijn verschillende soorten kunstenaars en verschillende soorten ontwerpers 
kunstenaar kunstenaar wil vooral dingen naar buiten brengen

hoort kunnen bij kunst? kunst komt van kunnen - is dat zo?? de visie en de droom is ook nodig

wij bepalen wie een kunstenaar wordt
de hype, kunstenaars worden eruit gepikt die belangrijk zijn

het taalgebruik is heel erg misbruikt, alles kan ambachtelijk of artisanaal, kunst hoeft niks te kunnen, etc
gregor vindt het woord artisan ook teveel gebruikt nu

de rol leraar, kennis doorgeven
de kunstenaar is klaar als het werk klaar is
het is een andere taak, 
wettelijk beschermde beroepsgroepen wel fan van, ook van vakopleiding
wat gregor opvalt als buitenlander is het missen van de inspiratie, een eenstroming land, iedereen stapt op de hype, iedereen een fatbike cowboy boots bakfiets, de diversiteit mist, er is weinig ruimte voor anders doen, het calvinistische doe maar gewoon dan doe je al gek genoeg
ineens is iedereen viltkunstenaar of tufter 
als het maar handel opbrengt!! en goed genoeg zesjesvultuur
mis de passie
passie voor dingen afwerken als duits ingenieur en modeontwerper, nederlanders vertrouwen op lekke systemen
het grootmoedige
onbruikbaar ontwerp 
gregor is echt een opleider, voorzichtig over het gebruik van het woord artisan

vakgebied spinnen
technologie technisch leidende draden 
en het creatieve, wat ik daarmee doe welke expressie

door dat samenspel van drie kan het wel zo genoemd worden
in nederland betekent het toch niks hahah
geeft uiteindelijk niet zoveel om de woorden

1. Context: Wat definieert een hedendaagse artisan? Kan je e-textiles op dezelfde ma- nier benaderen om tot een e-textile artisan te komen?
2. Ambacht: Wat zijn geschikte materialen en spintechnieken om ambachtelijk senso- ren te maken?
3. Textielontwerp: Wat maakt een ambachtelijk gemaakte sensor artisanaal? Waaraan moet een artisanale sensor voldoen om als toegepast textielontwerp te kunnen worden beschouwd?
4. Tactiliteit: Wat is de meerwaarde van handgesponnen t.o.v. industrieel vervaardig- de draden voor een rijke visuele en haptische ervaring van een tactiele sensor?




## Notes on the process
I.e. what did I learn

### Can you approach e-textiles in the same way to become an e-textile artisan?
With the definition of what it means to be an artisan, I would say yes - I think I can call myself a sensor spinster and e-textile artisan now. Not just because legally no one can stop me, but because I think I fit the requirements (that I came up with, but okay). In Sensor Spinster, the craft of spinning, technology and the creative expression come together in yarn made to interact with.

### 3. Textile design: What makes a crafted sensor artisanal? What requirements must an artisanal sensor meet to be considered applied textile design?
This question relates to the distinction made earlier between crafted versus artisanal. A crafted sensor becomes artisanal when the sensor is made with intention: the spinner takes control to make the yarn, not the fiber.

over de draden en sensoren die ik heb meegenomen
ik zie zelf een groot verschil in hoe ik de draden voorbereid, de vezel voorbereiding is echt de sleutel tot een prettig te spinnen draad
ik heb eigenlijk te lang me bezig gehouden met de alpaca die ik had gekocht te laten werken voor me, de voorgewassen en gekaarde en gekamde wol maakte de het proces zoveel makkelijker en het resultaat mooier
twist verlies bij het breien
bij de draden die een specifieke techniek zijn: klopt het? wat moet ik doen om ze te verbeteren?
bij sommige draden loop ik tegen machine verwerking restricties aan -> een breimachine schuift soms mâ€™n draad heen en weer waardoor de coils bijv gegroepeerd worden


wat zijn de problemen die je signaleert? roast my yarn

### 4. Tactility: What is the added value of handspun compared to industrially manufactured yarn for a rich visual and haptic experience of a tactile sensor?
Comparing to both industrially processed conductive yarn, and comparing to industrially processed conductive fabric

Before Sensor Spinster, I've knitted and woven plenty of tactile interfaces using the same machines as I am using in this project.

This question is to answer: why bother with all of this? Is it better?

I don't think it's necessarily better, but it's a different approach to technological textiles.

I think you can create beautiful things with industrially manufactured yarn, and the results may be more consistent and reliable than with handspun yarn. Industrially made yarn can be made at a larger scale, faster and cheaper, and can be processed with equally industrial machines. 

The problem that arises when the goal is a rich visual and haptic experience of a textile sensor I see with 

Industrially manufactured conductive yarn is mainly made for this industrial processing, which means it has to be quite thin and consistent in thickness, which are great achievements, but these qualities are not what I am looking for in yarn for more hands-on processing. 

 - thin in comparison to the yarn I like to 

When the yarn is this thin and consistent, it tends to blend into the fabric - you don't see the yarn itself so much as more the fabric as a whole. 

 too consistent 

Industrially produced yarns are less exciting in themselves so you rely more on their processing, whereas now the thread is sufficient and decisive for the final fabric.

Requirement list for the sensors

Technical and practical requirements
- Should be able to handle repeated touch, i.e. handle frictions and stress. Generally, worsted spun yarns are stronger and can handle more repeated use whereas woolen spun yarns tend to pill a little after repeated stress. 
- Conductive fibers/materials should be distributed as evenly as possible throughout the batt

Machine processing constraints - knitting on a domestic knitting machine:
- If the yarn is to be processed on a domestic knitting machine, it should not be too thick. If it's thicker than about 5mm, it's very hard to knit it even on a coarse knitting machine, especially when it's dense. When using beaded yarn, the beads have to be less than 4mm thick, otherwise they do not fit through the orifice of the knitting machine carriage. I used 5mm thick beads, and they did not fit.

Machine processing constraints - weaving:
- When weaving with conductive yarns in the weft, you can basically use any thickness. However, if the warp is too dense, you may end up covering up a lot of the yarn, so the warp should leave enough room for the yarn to shine

Variable resistance sensors:
- Should not be too dense - when the yarn is very dense, it's harder to get a good contrast in conductivity, which makes it less useful for a variable resistance based sensor

Capacitance based sensors:


## 2. Craft: What are suitable materials and spinning techniques to make crafted sensors?
Looking back on my spinning process over the past months, I've learned a lot about a variety of non-conductive and conductive fibers, how to prepare them for spinning consistently and how to best process them into woven and knitted sensors that work reliably for interactive textile interfaces. In this part, I'm elaborating on my material research, fiber preparation and spinning techniques suitable for spinning. 

First, a mini glossary:
- Top - combed fibers
- Batt - carded fibers
- Rolag - rolled-up cylinder of wool
- Puni - smaller rolag (for shorter fibers)

## Material research 
### Conductive materials
For the conductive materials to spin with, I looked into two categories - fibers and wires. Although spinning techniques can also be applied to existing (conductive) yarns, it's my goal to make my own yarns starting from the fiber. However, I read in my favorite spinning book (The Spinner's Book of Yarn Designs by Sarah Anderson) that if you need a strong material that will not be (very) noticable in the final yarn, it may as well be commercial yarn, and I think I can get behind that (and over my purist intentions). 

I am also applying this view to 100% conductive wires and filaments, because it doesn't really add to my research to make fully conductive threads myself, especially if they are going to be hidden. I also think there is value in wrapping handspun yarn in thin conductive wires - like my [favorite yarn](https://bart-francis.be/nl/etextile-high-tech-garen-co/etextile-linen-gimp-fantasy-and-practical-aplications-50-gr-100-met/a-5342-128) from Bart & Francis. The research of spinning with conductive wire is only a small part of the project; the focus is on conductive fibers.

**Fibers**
I settled on the following conductive fibers to research:
- [Stainless steel fibers](https://imattec.com/en/stainless-steel.php) - 110mm variocut, 8 micron, bulk (Immatec, mixed directions)
- [Stainless steel fibers](https://imattec.com/en/stainless-steel.php) - 110mm variocut, 12 micron, sliver (Immatec, combed)
- [Crimped conductive fibers](https://www.shieldex-shop.com/en/product-page/shieldex-crimped-fibers) (Shieldex)
- [Steel wool 00000 for sanding](https://www.amazon.nl/Shineboc-Herbruikbaar-Krasbestendig-gereedschap-Messing-16m/dp/B0CMTF2STP) 
- [Conductive wool - stainless steel fibers and merino wool mix](https://bart-francis.be/nl/etextile-high-tech-garen-co/merinox-wool-rostfree-steel-fibers-mix-50-gram-ball/a-3598-128) (Bart & Francis)

In the end, I did not use the steel/wool mix from Bart & Francis, since I wanted to compare only 100% conductive fiber options and do the blending with non-conductive fibers myself.

**Wire**
To look into spinning with commercial conductive wire, I got the following two options:
- [Uncoated 0,1mm copper wire](https://www.koper-draad.nl/product/05-kg-01mm-ongelakt-koperdraad/)
- [Monofilament thin stainless steel wire](https://www.shieldex-shop.com/en/product-page/shieldex-150-%CE%BC-monofil)

I only used the copper wire since it worked very well (both in spinning and in the resulting resistance/capacitance ranges) and it would make comparing the spun yarns easier if there was only type of wire used.

**Beads**
I also saw some spinning techniques which used beads, that I wanted to try out, so I bought a bunch of metal beads online (at an Aliexpress shop which no longer exists) in various sizes.
- Round, 5mm with 3mm diameter hole
- Round, 2mm with 1mm diameter hole
- Disc, 5mm with 2mm diameter hole

I did not use the disc shaped beads after I learned that the 5mm beads were too thick to be knitted.

**Coatings**
Finally, I looked at a bunch of coating options, but since these are more finishes and not necessarily part of spinning, I'm leaving them out of this research. They also tend to be pretty expensive, messy and sometimes even hazardous.

### Non-conductive (insulating)
All of my non-conductive fibers have been sourced from markets (mostly the Weversmarkt in Hoorn), Marktplaats and Bart & Francis (the ones from Bart & Francis I already had, I did not buy new fibers there). These fibers basically formed the carrier and gave the hand spun yarn their characters. I got the following materials:

- Alpaca - dutch alpaca wool bought on Marktplaats (I came to regret this later as described above)
- Sheep - all kinds of combed top and carded batts from various breeds of mainly dutch sheep (such as solognote, herdwick, zwartbles, merino etc). I also got some unwashed sheep wool (I think zwartbles but I'm not sure) from a spinner I met on Schiermonnikoog which I haven't spun yet
- Silk - I fell in love with sari silk, which is silk fibers from shredded sari fabric. I bought it at markets. I also had some leftover dark blue silk fibers ('haspelzijde') from Bart & Francis
- Banana - very smooth, silky fibers sourced from banana from the Weversmarkt
- Cotton - unbleached cotton fibers from Bart & Francis
- Flax - I found a bag of flax top in a second hand store in Haarlem 
- Acrylic - firestar effect fibers and a white/green blend from Bart & Francis 

In my spinning process, I decided to focus on sheep and alpaca wool as the main fibers. This is because they are the most commonly found in the Netherlands, available in a large variety, and are largely from local animals. On top of that, they are also very nice to spin. For the plant-based fibers, different preparation processes are sometimes needed (like heckling for flax), and since my fiber blending research is focused on carding and combing, this would not make sense. Furthermore, finer fibers like cotton need carders with way more teeth per inch (TPI) than I had. I also think it makes sense to limit the amount of non-conductive fiber types since the research is about the combination with conductive materials. I did however use silk, banana and acrylic fibers in small quantities as effect fibers for visual and tactile purposes.

### Fiber preparation
The biggest thing I've learned in this project is that fiber preparation is everything. I've taken it into account already in my project proposal, but I did not really account for it as much as I should have. Good fiber selection and good fiber preparation make a yarn pleasant to spin, and even more importantly, distribute the conductive materials evenly along the combed top or carded batt. I'll discuss fiber sourcing, carding and combing here.

**Sourcing fiber**
Two mistakes I made in the beginning of my project was to buy unwashed, unpicked and uncarded alpaca wool (first mistake) on Marktplaats (second mistake) sorted in two different qualities (A and B, mostly relating to fiber length) and 3 different colors. Since I had experience with the raw material already I figured it would be a beautiful (to the eye and to the touch), nice to work with and inexpensive starting point, but it ended up costing me way more time than I anticipated in washing (and waiting for it to dry) and carding it by hand. I learned that it's better to spend a bit more money on fibers that have already been washed and carded (and dyed) and are ready for use. 

The second lesson is that when buying raw (non-conductive) materials, you need to feel and see them first - this became very obvious when I went to the weversmarkt in Hoorn. Every sheep/alpaca/plant fiber is different and seeing and touching the material is essential before buying. I got the alpaca from Marktplaats shipped to my house, and then I realized both how much I had bought, how short the fibers were, and how many thick prickly hairs (kemp) there were. You can see this clearly in the yarn I made with the B quality fiber, there are a lot of fibers poking out and it's very prickly.

The sourcing process for conductive fiber happened online only, since conductive materials are not very common in markets or shops, apart from copper wire (electronics stores) and steel wool for sanding and cleaning (hardware stores). Steel fibers are mostly found on websites of the companies producing them, and you usually have to e-mail them or fill in a form to get a quote. They are mainly sold to other businesses, and are only available in small sample quantities for high prices or in large quantities. As a small individual textile designer, this is not very convenient, but I still managed to get some different conductive fibers to do my research with from the french company Immatec (through e-mail) and the german company Shieldex (through their sample webshop). 

### Tools
I've used a variety of tools for this project: some donated, some bought, some made and some borrowed.

- Spinning wheel (a scotch tension Louet donated by Marina van der Velden, the mother of my neighbour to whom I am very, very very grateful :) )
- Hand carders (one coarse pair that came with the spinning wheel, another 72 TPI pair bought at GF Carders)
- Blending board (108 TPI)
- Wool combs (made myself using a 66% scaled down version of [this print](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4856336) using 3.1 mm nails since wool combs are ridiculously expensive)
- Diz (made myself by printing [this file](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4858896))
- Drum carder (I visited the textile workshop where I used to work at Utrecht University of the Arts multiple times to make use of their drum carder)
- Treadle weaving loom (made use of one at the Weefacademie Sytze Roos)
- Domestic knitting machine (a fine gauge machine I already owned; a coarse gauge machine I made use of at Utrecht University of the Arts)

**Carding and combing fibers**
For the sake of this project, I bought hand carders (72 TPI which means teeth per inch; this is a nice jack of all trades for carding various fiber types) and a blending board (108 TPI). I did not buy a drum carder, because they are pretty expensive and bulky. However, when I bought the blending board, I thought that I could use them for mixing in conductive fibers evenly, but that really didn't work and it's not what they are for. I also hoped that I could use them to card raw wool. However, blending boards are for blending clean, combed or carded fibers and designing fiber arrangements with, not for actually blending and mixing fibers. I learned that that is not really what I was looking for: I primarily wanted to mix the conductive fibers very well to distribute conductivity throughout the resulting yarn. The rolags and batts I made with the blending board had the different fibers used distinctly visible. I do think that the blending board can come in handy when designing yarn with a combination of carded conductive and non-conductive blends, but I didn't use it a lot during the research.

Hand carding is a lovely process of lightly brushing two carding brushes loaded with fiber over each other, to straighten and fluff up the fibers. The resulting batt is not very large and doesn't produce a lot of yarn, but it's just enough for a swatch. I used the hand carders quite often in this project. You can roll up the fiber into a neat roll called a rolag, which is used in long draw spinning. With hand carding it's important to not overload the carder, otherwise carding is harder and drafting from the resulting rolag is harder. 

Drum carding - carding fibers with a hand-cranked machine with two rollers with carding cloth - is my favorite process and I ended up doing most of my fiber preparation like this, simply because it works the best and fastest. With an 80 gram batt from a full averagely sized drum carder like the [Louet Drumcarder Standard](https://www.spinspul.nl/en/product/louet-drumcarder-standard-72-tpi/) that I used mainly, you can spin multiple hanks of yarn of different types to compare and make multiple sensor swatches with the same batt, or spin a lot of yarn of the same type for a larger sensor swatch. I do not own a drum carder as they're pretty expensive, but I was able to make use of one close to my studio in Utrecht.

I also made wool combs, since I tried this fiber preparation process during a workshop I followed by Gregor Falkenhagen from Men at Wool and found that the resulting combed top is very evenly mixed, which is what I wanted. The problem is that it takes very long, and it produces a lot of waste. In the end I prefered carding the same batt multiple times for better consistency over combing small amounts of wool, because I found that the distribution of conductive fibers in batts (carded well) was already good enough to detect useful resistance and capacitance ranges in the resulting yarn. Combing worked a little too well, and the resulting yarn was smooth but a little one dimensional in my opinion. With carding, you have more design freedom.

### Suitable materials 
**Conductive fibers review**
While working with the 8 micron conductive fibers (the mixed direction ones) I noticed that they love to tangle together and form clumps during the (hand) carding process already. Carding them separately beforehand can help a little bit but not significantly. Blending them with other fibers directly on the blending board is not too easy but okay if itâ€™s not too much at once, but it still clumps and tangles while spinning; it feels like they're felted together. I ended up not using this material after the first few samples since it was too frustrating to spin and I couldn't get it to be blended evenly. Even when I was spinning just the conductive fiber, it resulted in very uneven yarn.

I then continued with the 12 micron aligned conductive fibers that looked more like combed top and where way more manageable to process.

<!-- In the beginning of the project I worked a lot with raw alpaca wool, but that was time consuming and messy, although during the carding most of the debris and dust falls out.  -->



#### Knitting 
- Fine gauge knitting machine is really not suitable for thicker yarns - this is something that I should've thought about beforehand since it's pretty logical. I only have a fine gauge knitting machine, and although I looked into getting a coarse knitter on Marktplaats, they tend to be way more expensive than fine gauge machines. Luckily I could make use of a coarse knitting machine at my previous workplace (thank you Manon!). 
- I used mainly stitch size 7-10 on the coarse knitter using all needles. When knitting with handspun yarn, making swatches is essential to figure out the correct stitch size to make the yarn shine. I only made one swatch for each yarn and decided on the stitch size based on my intuition (i.e. my experience with knitting). This worked out okay-ish, but resulted in some swatches being too stiff and others beingt too open. When a swatch is too stiff, sometimes the special features of the yarn is completely hidden within the stitches, which is a shame. With more time and more yarn I could have made more tests, but I had neither.

## Results
The physical results of this project are the Sensor Spinster swatch archive with resistance and capacitance tester, the woven work and the knitted work. All three take the shape of a 'pronkrol' (roughly translated as roll to show off): a scroll on a big spool that historically was used by young women to demonstrate their mastery of various textile crafts.

## Archive with swatch 
For the physical sensor archive version like a pronkrol / souvenir de ma jeunesse on a scroll on a big spool.
<https://www.momu.be/en/collection-stories/samplers-and-sewing-education> digital version with horizontal scroll

Connections: since I want it to be modular (being able to take off samples easily), I can't just sew them to the base scroll. I spent a bit too long looking into book screws, but they're pretty big in both visible diameter (10mm) and inner diameter (since it needs to accomodate a screwing mechanism) so they're not very subtle. Other options are:
- tie tacks with butterfly clutch
- 

## Swatch tester
Requirements
- Variable resistance measurement and mapping to light or sound
- Touch detection and triggering light or sound (possibly also variable capacitance mapping)

Possibly making a variable voltage divider so that I can tune the swatches, since they do not all have the same resitance range
