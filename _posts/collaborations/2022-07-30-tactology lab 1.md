DRAAD was developed during the first Tactology Lab program. It is a wearable string instrument made by Wouter van Veldhoven, Gert-Jan van der Kooij and me.
<br><br>
The strings on the garment are conductive yarn and can be magnetized. Wouter recorded sounds on these strings, that can be played with the glove. By varying speed and direction the sounds become audible. If you listen carefully, you can trace the origin of the sounds. But over time they become more and more abstract and further removed from their origins.
<br><br>
This work was presented for the first time during [Gaudeamus Festival 2021](https://gaudeamus.nl/events/electronica-for-lovers-dag-1/tactology-lab/) at de Nijverheid, Utrecht.
