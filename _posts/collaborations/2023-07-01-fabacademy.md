# [Fabacademy]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/"}})

From January to June 2023, I had the opportunity to participate in the Fabacademy at the Amsterdam Fablab (Waag Futurelab). The Fabacademy is a globally distributed course that allows people from all over the world to engage in hands-on learning within the connected fablab community. 

Throughout the program, I documented everything I made, messed up and experimented with on my documentation blog [here](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/waag/students/michelle-vossen/). Everything I learned, my design files and code, is open source and readily available there.

### About the Fabacademy
"Fab Academy is an intensive ﬁve-month program that teaches students to envision, design and prototype projects using digital fabrication tools and machines. It is a multi-disciplinary and hands-on learning experience that empowers students to learn-by-doing and inspires them to make stuff locally to become active participants in sustainable cities and communities.

At the Fab Academy, you will learn how to envision, prototype and document your ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools. We take a variety of code formats and turn them into physical objects. The Fab Diploma is the result of the sum of Fab Academy Certificates. Progress towards the diploma is evaluated by a student’s acquired skills rather than time or credits.

The Fab Academy is a fast paced, hands-on learning experience where students plan and execute a new project each week! Each individual documents their progress for each project, resulting in a personal portfolio of technical accomplishments." (via <https://fabacademy.org/>)
