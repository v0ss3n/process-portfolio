# [Fabacademy]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/"}})

From January to June 2023, I had the opportunity to participate in the Fabacademy at the Amsterdam Fablab (Waag Futurelab). The Fabacademy is a globally distributed course that allows people from all over the world to engage in hands-on learning within the connected fablab community. 

Throughout the program, I documented everything I made, messed up and experimented with on my documentation blog [here](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/waag/students/michelle-vossen/). Everything I learned, my design files and code, is open source and readily available there.
