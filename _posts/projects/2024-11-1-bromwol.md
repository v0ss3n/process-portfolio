bromwol (2024) is an interactive installation exploring textiles as electronic musical instruments. 

It is a collaborative project between Dianne Verdonk, Michelle Vossen and Roald van Dillewijn. Literally meaning humming wool, they experimented with carded sheep wool mixed with conductive fibers to create fuzzy interfaces for musical performance. Dianne & Roald performed with bromwol; in between performances the audience was invited to try it out themselves. 

bromwol was presented at U? Festival in Utrecht on November 9 2024. The development of bromwol is supported by Sounds Like Touch.

You can watch the video of the performances and interactive exhibition on the [Sounds Like Touch website](https://www.soundsliketouch.com/project/bromwol){:target="_blank"}
