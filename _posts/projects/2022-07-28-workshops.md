[Electronics & Tactility workshop](https://gaudeamus.nl/en/events/terrapolis-xl-day-2/workshop-electronics-tactility-door-michelle-vossen-en-veerle-pennock-acid-solder-club/) hosted by Sounds Like Touch at their workshop at the Hof van Cartesius during Gaudeamus festival - Terrapolis XL. A walk-in workshop in collaboration with Veerle Pennock. 

## Workshop description: 
"E-textiles offer the possibility to convert soft touches, pinching movements, or stretchy knitted fabric into data. By using electrically conductive yarns to create electronic circuits and components (by embroidering or knitting, for example), you can control fantastic things such as sound, light, and movement. Designer and maker Michelle Vossen together with soldering and hardware expert Veerle Pennock, also the founder of Acid Solder Club, offer you an accessible introduction to the world of electronics. In this walk-in workshop, they teach you different textile techniques that you can then use independently to make your own soft sensors, resistors, and other components."

[Knitting Technology workshop](https://oddstream.nl/workshop-knitting-technology/) hosted by Oddstream at the Lindenberg Cultuurhuis in Nijmegen, with a lecture by Veerle Spronck.

## Workshop description:
"Knitting and computing have more in common than you might expect. We’ll research this subject in the workshop Knitting Technology on Thursday April 21st. The workshops starts with a talk about the subject. After that we’ll all go to work with fiber art, nitting machines and knitted electronic circuits."
