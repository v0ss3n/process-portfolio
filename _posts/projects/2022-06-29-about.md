Hi! I'm Michelle, and I am a maker and designer based in the Netherlands. I work for the Waag Fablab, Textilelab and Maker Education Lab as a maker educator. I graduated from ArtEZ in Fashion Design in 2019 and I did the Fab Academy in 2023. 
<br><br>
My fascination lies in embracing the absurd in technology, exploring the erratic nature of machines, and experimenting with software in unconventional ways. Machine-made does not equal perfection, because a lot can go wrong: that unpredictability is what makes it so valuable. This 'ghost in the machine' is at the heart of what I do. My goal is more collaboration between designers and machines. A machine is not just an instrument: it can be a partner in the process, coming up with great design proposals. 
<br><br>
My practice can be found at the convergence of textiles, craft and technology. I'm a strong advocate of learning-by-making, diving into projects with enthusiasm, optimism, and a touch of overconfidence, as it often gets you the furthest. This same spirit shines through in the labs, projects, and workshops I engage with at Waag Futurelab, HKU, and beyond.
<br><br>
You can reach me at <a title="{{ site.email }}" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> if you want to work with me. I give workshops and host events in the field of textiles, digital design & fabrication and electronics. Some behind the scenes of previous events can be found <a href="{{ "/workshops" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" title="{{ page.project.title }}" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
