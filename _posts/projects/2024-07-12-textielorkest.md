In the interactive sound installation Textile orchestra I investigate how electronic textiles can be used as musical interfaces for the audience. This space houses a collection of old and new knitted, woven and stitched works that come together for the first time as instruments of an orchestra. The instruments can be played separately, but if several works are played simultaneously, they  together form one large concert, a cacophony of sound 
triggered by touching and manipulating the e-textile sensors.

Traditional musical instruments can be a barrier due to the potentially steep learning curve. Instruments that donâ€™t look like one open doors for visitors to compose intuitively. When visitors enter, they are the orchestra members: the audience is the performer. You can touch the works in this space: push, pull, squeeze, stretch, push, twist... Investigate how you can trigger and manipulate sounds by setting the textiles in motion and how the haptic perception of electronic textiles is translated into spontaneous compositions.
