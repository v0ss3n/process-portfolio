## MIDI Madness Maker
The MIDI Madness Maker is a PCB designed in collaboration with Veerle Pennock to bridge the gap between electronic textiles and hardware synthesizers. It's an accessible, educational DIY kit they use to teach workshops at home and abroad on soldering electronics, Arduino programming, and creating e-textiles.

## Atari Punnik Console
The Atari Punnik Console is also an education DIY kit based on the Atari Punk Console. It is designed in collaboration with Veerle Pennock. With this kit, you can make analog noise like with an Atari Punk Console, but with e-textile sensors instead of knobs only.

## t-t-t-t
The t-t-t-t (textile touch to tones) is a pre-programmed and manufactured PCB designed to turn e-textile surfaces into wireless MIDI keyboards.
