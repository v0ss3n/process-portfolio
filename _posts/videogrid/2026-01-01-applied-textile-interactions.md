This week:
- I wove three new samples, and edited some textiles I already had to make asymmetric interactive surfaces. 
- I tested with various people in different experiments: intuitive gestures without clues, gestures after giving some hints, and concrete scenarios. 
- And I enacted scenarios myself with textile interaction and lamps.  
- I also tried two electronic outputs: a LED strip and sound.

# Intuitive gestures without clues
When I was filling the textiles, some classmates immediately started playing with the textiles and using it as a blanket, and a tool for absent-minded fidgeting and comfort.

Here I asked people to just interact with the textiles how they seemed fit.

- When there is no output to the interaction, it becomes more of a playing around 
- They mentioned that it sounded like a cat purring and it was like petting; and you could do it from both sides
- What I noticed that they didn't do, was squeeze or slap the thicker areas; that would be immediately what I would do, but maybe that's because I know that I would put a sensor in there
- Playing with the floats is popular, as is stretching
- Some people ignore the bubbles, some people use them as handles, but not really as buttons
- With more abstract textiles the interactions are more varied and unexpected to me

# Gestures with clues

## Imagining textiles as an interactive doormat
Clue: this is a doormat, and how you walk on it can turn on and off the light? Or if you needed to fill in a code, or something else would happen as you walk in?

## Imagining textiles as an interactive door
Clue: this is a door, how would you enter?

- The hanging method of the textile affords it to be moved aside. 
- The asymmetric pattern seems to indicate the area from where you need to open.
- If there was a code, there needs to be sound feedback.
- It helped to fake the interaction ('becoming the door') to imagine how it could work.

## Carpets
Here it was more of an exploration of how you would want to interact, and see where it led. Daphné mentioned that the thicker areas reminded her of foot reflexology, and that it felt nice to the bottom of the feet. I then also tried it.

Here we imagined the textiles as a key pad, where I tried to copy Daphné's choreography.

Both Daphné and Hana did this 'wobbling' motion with their feet on the thicker areas. The third video was shaped by the question: what if the carpet controls the lights in a room?

# Matching input and output

## Controlling lights with feet
I then tested myself how input interaction and output as light could look like.

# Electronic tests
Without something happening as a direct consequence of the interaction, the interaction is not complete. The interaction is directly influenced by something that happens as a reaction to the interaction. But I do see that even without a direct output, the textile itself can already communicate a lot, and if I don't take that into account, people will not interact with textiles how I need them to interact with it. It varies from person to person how people start exploring a textile so far. 

## Gestures with direct sound feedback
The difference in approach to touch needs to be accounted for when designing the textiles. I touch it very differently because I know how I programmed and connected it.

## Gestures with direct light feedback
Clue: there is something hidden. How would you touch it?

- Jay said he would be more drawn to touch a certain area if something happens i.e. a light turns on
- Daphné said that it was a logical place to her to stroke it on the lighter area; she started in the larger area but tried both directions. Stella just stroked it through the middle and said she would ignore it.
