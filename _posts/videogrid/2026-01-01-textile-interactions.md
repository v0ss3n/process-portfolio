# Textile > touch
Going from 2D surfaces to flexible textile surfaces; the shift in focus is in the entire interaction with a textile, not just with a surface, and on the inherent position within the textiles instead of a fixed position in space (so far) . Textiles afford different interactions than touchscreens. 

I'm not focusing on sound output now, but on how the textiles is inspiring interaction (textile directs a touch choreography?): exploring affordances and signifiers (“Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both.” (Don Norman)). The affordances can change through contextualization. Now most interactions are just involving the hands and fingers, not really the full body. 

Overall, with these interactions I feel like I am drifting away from actually choreographing the interaction; right now it's more of an exploration of the signifiers and affordances of a specific textile, and it's really all about __touch with the fingers__ instead of an entire body interaction (this also has to do with scale and positioning). This is also because the textiles are presented all in the same manner - context and output are intertwined with how clear the communication of the textile is. Also - flat surfaces give less variety in interaction than shaped textile objects. 

The communication of a textile should go beyond a line or dot that indicates a certain gesture, because it's just boring. Like it's easy to make a wave or line pattern, but why would I do that? Why would I use it as a wallpaper or tablecloth - why is it textiles when it's a 2D surface anyway? 

I'm not primarily interested in everyday interactions with textiles, and in textiles being constantly used as a calming/soothing pleasant experience for healthcare. I'm also not looking for somaesthetic design where it's about a more conscious bodily experience. I guess I relate most to Sara Mlakar's Odd Interactions

I couldn't weave so I did sublimation printing, patchwork with previous samples, and used existing samples. 

- Sara Mlakar - sound of textile installation is a translation of textures to different sounds
- [Gestalt Principles](https://www.gestaltprinciples.com/)


## What to do next
- Maybe instead of directing/choreographing through static surface design I should embed light in textiles that can direct gestures
- Or actually directing it with the sound

## 1. Sublimation prints
Design signifiers (looking at Gestalt principles)
1. Circular motion/gesture
2. Fanning out directions from a central point
3. Two linear directions in opposite direction
4. Linear in one direction aligned

Notes:
- no tactile differences where the print is, so you need to see 'where to touch'.
- as a flimsy fabric that doesn't have a clear place and purpose, the intended interaction is also not very clear
- it shows that a print without intent and a textile without context doesn't actually choreograph an interesting motion
- it does become a little more interesting when the textile is placed on the body 
- I do think that when there is a sound as direct feedback, it confirms the correct interaction(s)
- arrows are the clearest to me, but also more abstract direction indicated with color and gradients

## 2. Woven textiles 
Notes:
- thick waffles encourage sticking your fingers in the waffles and pressing it
- 'wavy' ribs encourage perpendicular stroking

interaction notes
- repeated woven patterns make it hard to direct one specific interaction
- interactions are very hand-focused (or hand/gesture); 
- surface design or like a print gives a clearer intended direction. some textures give pleasant touch interactions but the interaction doesn't **look** interesting > I want to choreograph it right?? but then how do I want people to move? 
- when there is a clear contrast in texture, you know where to touch and how to follow the path just by touching
- some interactions are still clear even when the fabric is folded, some information gets lost
- some textures are very directional vertical/horizontal

Textile-specific interactions observed:
- stretching
- pinching
- folding
- rolling and unrolling
- can be moved around and draped differently
- stroking and petting

## 5. Projecting gestures
Choreography is preprogrammed to appear, non-verbal communication of interaction. Gesture-based, not touch based.
