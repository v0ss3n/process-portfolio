# Workshops

I'm obsessed with exploring textiles as tactile interfaces and love to share my passion for crafting soft interactions through various events. You can join one of my workshops to explore the possibilities of e-textiles, incorporating traditional textile crafts like embroidery, weaving, and knitting and translating touch to sounds and visuals. If this sparks your interest, don't hesitate to reach out to me at <a title="{{ site.email }}" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>. I'm also happy to design cross-disciplinary workshops so if you have an idea or want me to come up with a fun cross-over, let me know.

Take a glimpse at some past workshop impressions, and stay updated on upcoming workshops and events by following me on <a title="Instagram" href="{{ site.instagram }}" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!

## Past workshops
- [Waag Open: Crafts x Electronics](https://waag.org/nl/event/waag-open-handwerk-x-elektronica-uitverkocht/)
  Workshop at Waag Futurelab in collaboration with Veerle Pennock on October 5, 2023. During this Waag Open edition, we taught the participants various textile techniques to make their own soft sensor. We focused on sound as output: at the end of the evening, we tested the DIY sensors with a modular synthesizer, so we could jam with our soft instruments.

- [Electronics & Tactility workshop](https://gaudeamus.nl/en/events/terrapolis-xl-day-2/workshop-electronics-tactility-door-michelle-vossen-en-veerle-pennock-acid-solder-club/)
  Walk-in workshop in collaboration with Veerle Pennock at the Sounds Like Touch makerspace at the Hof van Cartesius during Gaudeamus festival - Terrapolis XL on September 11, 2022. In the workshop we taught various textile techniques to partipants to make their own DIY soft sensor.


- [Knitting Technology workshop](https://oddstream.nl/workshop-knitting-technology/) 
  Workshop hosted by Oddstream at the Lindenberg Cultuurhuis in Nijmegen, with a lecture by Veerle Spronck, on April 21, 2022. During this event we started out with an opening lecture on the shared history of knitting and technology and how it's intertwined with gendered stereotypes. After that we explored commonalities between fiber arts and computers by coding punch cards, working with knitting machines, and creating our own knitted electronic circuits.

- [Deconstruction/Reconstruction](https://iterations.online/#workshops) 
  Workshop at Iterations symposium hosted at Soup (Rotterdam), on December 16, 2023. In this workshop we crafted soft sensors and visualized the interactions in Processing.

- [Craft & Electronics: Workshop textile & sound](https://theoverkill.nl/program/craft-electronics/)
  Workshop in collaboration with Veerle Pennock at The Overkill Festival in Enschede, on November 19, 2023. In this workshop in the middle of the festival, we crafted soft sensors and made the output audible using a modular synthesizer setup.
