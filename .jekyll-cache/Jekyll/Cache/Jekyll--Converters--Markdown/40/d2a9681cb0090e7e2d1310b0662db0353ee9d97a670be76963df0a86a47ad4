<p>For these experiments I am hiding visually encrypted messages in 2d prints using transfer paper. Before this I tried 3D printing but that did not turn out to be a great method for hiding these messages as they were either indecipherable or falling off the fabric. For more information on the process, go to <a href="\textilelab\2019\11\01\3d-printing-experiments-on-fabric-(visual-cryptography).html">this page</a>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>When using transferpaper make sure that you mirror your image before you print it on the paper</li>
  <li>A heat press usually works better than an iron</li>
  <li>If you do use an iron, take your time (especially with synthetic seethrough materials like I did)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note how when laying flat the symbol is vaguely visible, only when you are looking for it.</p>
