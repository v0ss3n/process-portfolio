<p><em>Liza Stark</em></p>

<p>This second class on the topic of wearables and e-textiles will provide a more advanced coverage on soft sensors and actuators and programming interactions.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The slides can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s_StEoFFkxUgGzaQmpCSZWH_IqyVzPo7st1fMzgCEDg/edit#slide=id.g6406fb76bb_0_0">here</a>. Use the slides as a repository, thereâ€™s a lot of practical information.</p>

<p>Visual:</p>
<ul>
  <li>LEDs
    <blockquote>
      <p>Connect LED to Arduino with a 220 Ohm resistor (in parallel only 3 LEDs max. with one resistor)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Neopixels
    <blockquote>
      <p>LED strip, address LEDs individually on a microcontroller (you need a microcontroller, cannot use without; download neopixel library for Arduino). Available as strips/rings/matrices/sewable/regular</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Fiber optics
    <blockquote>
      <p>Light shines in one end and emerges at the other end, quality of fiber determines brightness. Side emitting fibers are also available. Connections are a bit tricky, see slides for documentation; donâ€™t let the light escape at the connection</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Thermochromic ink
    <blockquote>
      <p>Ink/pigment that reacts to heat (becomes colorless once a certain temperature is reached). Pigments can be mixed with different substrates. To heat the circuit we need a secondary power source because Arduino cannot provide enough. For this we use transistors (drain, source, gate). Keep heating up and cooling down times in mind</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sound:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speakers
    <blockquote>
      <p>Electromagnets: create a fabric speaker. See slides for tutorial on how to make one. You can also make an amp, DFPlayer Mini plays audio files from SD card</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Motion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shape memory alloys (SMAs)
    <blockquote>
      <p>Flexinol (very difficult to make it work apparently). SMAs when heated go to a specific shape (either trained or untrained; untrained shrinks and trained goes into a shape determined by a heating process). Works best with lightweight materials. Liza uses .008 materials thickness (in inches). Use for folding/curling/smocking. Cannot be soldered directly, use crimp beads are very useful. Use the same heat controlling circuit as the thermochromic inks</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Flip dots
    <blockquote>
      <p>Magnetic ball/bead with one or two coils</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
