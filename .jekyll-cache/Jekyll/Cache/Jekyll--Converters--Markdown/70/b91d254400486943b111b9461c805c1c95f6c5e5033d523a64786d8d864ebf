<p>I will document my experiments with natural dyes here. Be sure to check out the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ar8j0cJntsFiBxdnrhqTA_9lgDDzB1Wg/view">slides</a> for Fabricademy by Cecilia Raspanti.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs good to know what we‚Äôre talking about so I‚Äôll start with a little lexicon.</p>

      <td>Dye fixatives that are used to ‚Äòadhere‚Äô the dye to the fiber. They enhance the light- and wash-fastness. Alum, iron and copper are typically used (but they can also have an influence on the final color). Mordants can be used before, during or after dyeing.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Metal modifiers</td>
      <td>Copper modifiers make the colors duller and darker, and can bring out blue and green shades. Iron modifiers make the colors duller and darker.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Scouring</td>
      <td>Cleaning the fibers (especially vegetable fibers) with scouring agents like sodium ash (sodium carbonate/natrium carbonate). This is done to prepare the fabrics (removing waxes, pectins, dirt etc.) and make it more water absorbent.</td>

      <td>Stabilizers</td>
      <td>Stabilizers help with the even distribution of color in the water and onto the material (often salt is used).</td>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúTo stabilise and preserve the water based ink salt is a great addition, acids and alkali can be used to change to look of the colour, while arabic gum helps to thicken and stabilise the inks. Marker inks do not require salts and guar gum to be added.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use fresh (not dried) materials as the colors will be less bright</li>
  <li>Natural materials (wool, cotton, silk, linen) work best</li>
</ul>
