<p><a href="https://ninjatek.com/ninjaflex/">NinjaFlex</a> is an incredibly flexible TPU filament. My Ender doesn’t have a filament extruder upgrade (or any upgrade for that matter), it uses a Bowden extruder in which flexible filaments tend to get stuck in no time. To overcome this issue without having to upgrade my printer (yet), I tensioned my filament by making a horizontal ‘bridge’ between a cupboard and my printer so the filament would be tensioned and fed to the extruder without too much trouble.</p>

<p>The first few attempts to get the print started ended up like the picture below. I fixed it by lowering the speed and properly aligning the print bed.</p>

<p>As you can tell at some point my walls were too high and too thin, so more and more filament was being extruded in the air. I tried to fix it with no succes.</p>
