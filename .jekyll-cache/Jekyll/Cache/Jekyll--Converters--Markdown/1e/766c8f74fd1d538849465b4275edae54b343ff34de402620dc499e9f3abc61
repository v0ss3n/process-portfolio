<p>I initially wanted to emboss text on my glove model, but as it turns out that is very difficult to do (at least the way I wanted it to work). It should be possible to directly â€˜drawâ€™ onto the model though so that is something I may try out later. The following is a visual summary of my struggles with Blender.</p>

<p>After that I decided to manipulate my glove with another nice feature in Blender that Jules showed me. (â€¦)</p>

<p>The first glove I printed was a pretty simple one, based off the glove model I made before (for glove molding). You can see in the picture below that the thumb and the area between the thumb and index finger arenâ€™t properly printing. The overhang was too much, resulting in the filament to start drooping.</p>

<p>I scaled the model to 125% after this print since I could barely fit it (and I have small hands).</p>
