<p>In this lecture participants will explore computational design methods towards a new reinterpretation of cloths, garments and accessories for fashion design, inspired by a new digital design methodology.</p>

<h2 id="rhino-6">Rhino 6</h2>
<p>If you’ve never worked with Rhinoceros before (like me) and you dive straight into Grasshopper it’s a bit much, so familiarize yourself with the Rhino interface first. Rhino is a command-driven program; the toolbars contain the graphical icons for the commands. <a href="https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/usersguide/en-us/index.htm">The documentation of Rhino is a great place to start</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NURBS (non-uniform rational B‑splines) are mathematical representations that can accurately model any shape from a simple 2‑D line, circle, arc, or box to the most complex 3‑D free‑form organic surface or solid. Because of their flexibility and accuracy, NURBS models can be used in any process from illustration and animation to manufacturing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>NURBS geometry is an industry standard for designers who work in 3‑D where forms are free and flowing; where both form and function is important. Rhino is used in marine, aerospace, and automobile interior and exterior design. Makers of household and office appliances, furniture, medical and sports equipment, footwear, and jewelry use Rhino to create free-form shapes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>NURBS modeling is also widely used by professional animators and graphic artists. The advantage of using NURBS over using polygon modelers is that NURBS surfaces have no facets. The models can be rendered at any resolution. A mesh can be created from the model at any resolution.</p>

<h2 id="grasshopper">Grasshopper</h2>
<p>First: why use grasshopper? What makes parametric design so useful? The video on the left explains this; the video on the right is a good tutorial to start with.</p>

    </div>

<p>Download all of the plugin linked to in the second video (in the description). If you don’t see them in the grasshopper tab menu, they probably have to be unblocked; to do this for all files at once in the libraries folder you have to open powershell there and use the command:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dir -Recurse | Unblock-File</code></p>

  <p><img src="/images/fabricademy/grasshopper/unblock.png" alt="unblock" />
<img src="/images/fabricademy/grasshopper/unblock2.png" alt="unblock" /></p>
</div>

<p>Brickbox is used to manage Grasshopper snippets, so you can save combinations of blocks to import later in other files. When saving a snippet make sure to double click ‘add new brick’, check the checkbox and click done (I first thought it didn’t work properly but the size of the dialog window is not right).</p>

<p>Rightclicking input/output:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reverse: reverses order of points &gt; changes direction. You can also use the Reverse List tool</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/fabricademy/grasshopper/reverse.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Simplify: simplifies the groups/group names. You can also use the Simplify Tree tool</li>
  <li>Flatten: all the curves go into one group (so instead of polyline curve group 1, 2, 3 you get one group with polyline 1, 2, 3). You can also use the Flatten Tree tool</li>
  <li>Graft: “Graft” and  “Flatten” changes the data structure inside a parameter. Sometimes it is necessary to modify the data structure because the default layout does not result in the desired operations. Imagine you divide 5 closed curves into 10 segments each. The result of this operation is a data structure of 5 lists with 10 items (points) each. If you were to Flatten this structure, you’d end up with a single list containing 50 items. If you were to Graft this structure, you’d end up with 50 lists of one item each. <a href="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/notes/index/show?noteKey=What_does_it_mean_to_graft_or_flatten%3F">source</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="parametric-patterns">Parametric patterns</h2>
<p>Using Grasshopper to generate parametric patterns (great for fashion prints and 3d printed fabrics) is magical and the tutorial below is really helpful and beginner friendly.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aVYz3hZers" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The final print file (both as Grasshopper file and as .STL) can be found at the bottom of this post.</p>

<h2 id="truchet-tiles">Truchet tiles</h2>
<p>Truchet tiles are great for seemingly organic geometric pattern design.</p>

<div class="row-2">
  <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Truchet_labyrinth.png" alt="" />
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Truchet_base_tiling.svg/800px-Truchet_base_tiling.svg.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>

<p>In information visualization and graphic design, Truchet tiles are square tiles decorated with patterns that are not rotationally symmetric. When placed in a square tiling of the plane, they can form varied patterns, and the orientation of each tile can be used to visualize information associated with the tile’s position within the tiling. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles">via Wikipedia</a></p>
