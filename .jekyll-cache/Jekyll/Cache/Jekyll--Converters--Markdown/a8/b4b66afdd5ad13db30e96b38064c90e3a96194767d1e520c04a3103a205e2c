<p>This printer doesn’t have a build-in display like the Prusa and Ultimaker. Printing is done directly from the computer via USB cable. The recommended software for this is <a href="https://www.pronterface.com/">Pronterface</a>, an open source ‘3D printing host software suite which talks to your printer and handles the printing process’. However you can also print straight from Ultimaker Cura, which is what I did. I would recommend using Pronterface though, since Cura offers limited control over the printer.</p>

<p>THe first few tests failed because the print wouldn’t adhere to the bed. Initially there was blue painter’s tape on the printer but it was dirty so I replaced it with a new layer. This was cheaper tape that was less firm and sticky, so when the bed heated up it curled up a bit at the corners.</p>

<p>The first try with blue paper tape (the printer went way too fast):</p>

<p>The second try with a fresh layer normal (but cheap) painter’s tape turned out even worse, with the filament not adhering at all and sticking to the nozzle:</p>

<p>Glue stick on painter’s tape looked promising at first but the print still didn’t adhere consistently.</p>

<p>Finally, using glue stick on painter’s tape and lowering the speed (50%) for the first layer as well as adding a brim did the trick. I also decreased the flow, but I should not have done that as you can clearly see the separate layers.</p>
