<p>Since my 3D printing samples on fabric were laying around everywhere, I wanted to make a box with a lid for them. This box was designed keeping the restrictions of a CNC milling machine in mind.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>I first started to design the box in Illustrator, but I quickly realized that this required a lot of imagining what the box would look like. I switched to Fusion360 so I could actually see in 3D what I was doing. Since I didnâ€™t have a lot of experience with Fusion360 and didnâ€™t know where to start, I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JZKSDSyP6g">this tutorial</a> (this is part one of four). You can skip the third and fourth video if you donâ€™t need any rendering and just need to the plans for the CNC machine.</p>

<p>To make a CAM layout I tired using the align tool recommended in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYj37I88-4g">this tutorial</a>. However, exporting the file as a dxf gave me a lot of issues so after that I projected all parts onto separate sketches.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create variables from the beginning. I did not do that but halway through modeling I started to regret that. Then you can let the software calculate all of your distances instead of having to do it yourself.</li>
  <li>Think about the paths you have to mill, VCarve Pro does not allow you to select separate paths so your vectors will have to be the path you want. I had to add extra outline paths because the paths I created in Fusion would have otherwise cut off my notches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below my process of modeling the box.</p>
