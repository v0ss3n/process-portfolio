<h5 id="first-concept-creating-a-system-with-open-source-textures">First concept: creating a system with open source textures</h5>
<p>To 3D-print on and lasercut or press directly into garments (with vinyl-cut patterns or frased molds), to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mend</li>
  <li>change size (bigger with properly placed cuts, smaller with pressed 3d patterns or 3D-printed structures that contract the fabric)</li>
  <li>change texture</li>
  <li>protect (reinforcing seams or adding padding to for example elbows and knees)</li>
  <li>lift and support (integrated bras and corset structures)</li>
</ul>

<p>A system like this is meant to give worn garments a second chance, for illfitting garments to fit once again and to protect both the garment and the wearer.</p>

<p>I could create an open source capsule collection out of existing vintage garments that have been transformed with these techniques and provide instructions how to do it yourself.</p>

<p>Another idea could be to have this system and a system of one size fits all garments that you can hyperpersonalize using above methods (but using existing garments is definitely more sustainable; also I found out that a similar concept already exists).</p>

<h5 id="output">Output</h5>
<p>For now, this project has two main goals. The first is developing an open source library with files and instructions on how to use a fablab to alter clothing. The library could be used in maker education (workshops etc.) and by other designers or whoever who wants to alter their clothes. The second is creating a capsule collection using the methods researched with secondhand garments, to demonstrate what is possible (and to display my fashion design skills). I would also like to do a photoshoot or video.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mend</li>
  <li>Change size: larger, smaller, longer, shorter</li>
  <li>Decorate</li>
  <li>Finish: hem, collar, neckline, sleeve</li>
  <li>Closing: clasp, button, hook</li>
  <li>Protect</li>
  <li>Support: bra, corset</li>
  <li>Enhance: add pocket</li>
