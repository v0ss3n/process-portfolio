<p>I am hiding visually encrypted images in double layered lace. For more information on the process, go to <a href="\textilelab\2019\11\01\3d-printing-experiments-on-fabric-(visual-cryptography).html">this page</a>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the python script (described on the page linked to above) on the image you want
    <blockquote>
      <p>Make sure the output images can be scaled up enough so you can add a grid on top</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Draw a rectangular grid on top of the two output images in Illustrator (click and hold the Line Segment tool and select the Rectangular Grid tool)
    <blockquote>
      <p>The amount of lines needed is the start size of the output images (amount of pixels horizontally and vertically) minus 1</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Export as PDF to get a clear export (all other options become blurry)</li>
  <li>Make a bitmap of the PDF in Photoshop (threshold 50%)</li>
  <li>Set the lasercutter to engrave but make sure that the laser actually cuts through the material by decreasing the speed and/or increasing the power</li>
</ul>
